engajamentoDiarioFull

Similar to daily_engagement.csv, but with engagement further broken down by
course and with more columns available. This file is about 500 megabytes, which
is why the smaller daily_engagement.csv file was created. This dataset is
optional; it is not needed to complete the course.

columns as daily_engagement.csv, except with has_visited instead of
num_courses_visited.
